The\n                    reason is that the charging free energies evaluated from such\n                    simulations are affected by very large errors. One of these is\n                    related to the choice of a specific convention for summing up\n                    the contributions of solvent charges to the electrostatic\n                    potential in the ionic cavity, namely, on the basis of point\n                    charges within entire solvent molecules (M scheme) or on the\n                    basis of individual point charges (P scheme). The use of an\n                    inappropriate convention may lead to a charge-independent\n                    offset in the calculated potential, which depends on the\n                    details of the summation scheme, on the quadrupole-moment\n                    trace of the solvent molecule, and on the approximate form\n                    used to represent electrostatic interactions in the\n                    system. However, whether the M or P scheme (if any) represents\n                    the appropriate convention is still a matter of on-going\n                    debate. The goal of the present article is to settle this\n                    long-standing controversy by carefully analyzing (both\n                    analytically and numerically) the properties of the\n                    electrostatic potential in molecular liquids (and inside\n                    cavities within them).},  \n}\"#)"
